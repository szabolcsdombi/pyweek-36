# Galactic Harvesters: The Canister Crusade

Dive into an exhilarating Python-powered odyssey where your spaceship embarks on a quest to harvest enigmatic Dark Matter canisters from the vast cosmos! ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ

## Story

In the year 3077, the Milky Way Galaxy is in the midst of an energy crisis.
The primary source of energy, a rare crystalline element called "Dark Matter" is nearing depletion.
Dark Matter is primarily stored in canisters that have been scattered throughout space over centuries due to space wars, trading routes, and exploration mishaps.

Captain Neil Starbreaker, the fearless pilot of the spacecraft "Nebula Harvester".
Neil used to be a space pirate but has since reformed after witnessing the dire effects of the energy crisis on his home planet, Noverra.

Captain Neil and his crew must navigate through various sectors of the galaxy to collect Dark Matter canisters while fending off enemies and competitors who are also in search of the same resource.

Rival collectors, space pirates, and even some rogue governmental factions will try to seize canisters from Neil.
The player have to engage in dogfights, use the environment to their advantage, and deploy various weapons and tech.

Collected Dark Matter can be used to power up the Nebula Harvester, but it can also be traded in the space station for ship upgrades, better weapons, stronger shields, and advanced tech like cloaking devices.

Based on the player's decisions, alliances can be formed or enemies made. For example, Neil might decide to share a stash of Dark Matter with a struggling colony, earning their trust and assistance later in the game. Alternatively, he could keep it all, ensuring more immediate resources for upgrades but potentially making new adversaries.

## TODO, TBD, Game Elements

- [x] ship upgrades
- [ ] better weapons (number of beams fired per second, the amount of ammo)
- [ ] stronger shields (number of hits required for ship explosion, health regeneration)
- [ ] advanced tech like cloaking devices (the distance the enemy uses to filter for the player)

- [x] rival collectors
- [ ] space pirates, rogue governmental factions (maybe different colors of ships)

- [ ] engage in dogfights
- [ ] alliances can be formed or enemies made
- [ ] sharing resources with a faction prevents them from shooting at the player
- [ ] or participating entirely in the canister collection, (they have enough they don't bother)

- [x] the home planet floats in the background
- [x] stars in the background
- [ ] minimap

- [ ] achievment for sharing enough dark matter with rivals to be alone in the canister collection phase
- [ ] achievment for a complete game without a single beam fired
- [ ] achievment for shooting down every rival (without missing participants)

- [ ] intro
- [ ] story told in-game
- [ ] game logic explained
